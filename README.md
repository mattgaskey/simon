# simon

A React-based Simon Says game, built for the last FreeCodeCamp Front-end
Development certificate.

React development stalled.  Project too simple to need state-handling
and individual components.  A simple VanillaJS version has been started
in its place.  Separation of concerns is kept through the adaptation
of React state, component functions and view rendering.
